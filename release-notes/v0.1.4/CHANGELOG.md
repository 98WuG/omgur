# v0.1.4

Thanks [minus7](https://github.com/minus7) for the PR! This update introduces:

- Support for lazy-loading album images.

Note that this update changes the registry for the GitLab docker images. If you were previously using `registry.geraldwu.com/gerald/omgur`, please point your manifests at `registry.wuhoo.xyz/jerry/omgur` instead. `registry.geraldwu.com` is retired and will be offlined soon.
